## Hi there üëã

The largest charitable network of Nepalis, [HELP NEPAL Network](https://helpnepal.net): One Dollar a Month Fund for Nepal is a global charity run on a fully voluntary basis.

The aim of the Network is to encourage Nepalis and those who love Nepal around the world to provide assistance in the fields of health, education and disaster relief support in rural Nepal. We envision a society where every relatively able individual contributes a small portion of their earnings for the benefit of those who genuinely need support. We have called this ‚ÄòPractical Philanthropy‚Äô, an approach which will not hamper an individual‚Äôs normal life but which will benefit disadvantaged communities.

HELP NEPAL Network Nepal, based in Kathmandu, co-ordinates and supervises the Network‚Äôs activities and projects in Nepal. It consists of a small group of dedicated volunteers without whose sincerity and dedication the Network would not have achieved what it has today. HeNN Nepal also works towards promoting a culture of giving within Nepal. For example, the HeNN teams abroad encourage Nepalis to ‚Äúhave a can of beer or a carton of juice less in a month and donate the savings to the fund‚Äù and HeNN Nepal encourages Nepalis at home to ‚Äúhave a plate of momo or a few cups of tea less in a month and donate the savings to the fund.‚Äù We believe that society in particular and the world in general would be a much better place if every individual were to have a cultivated sense of charity.

If you are interested in helping in any way, please do get in touch with  us. HELP NEPAL Network welcomes your encouragement and support.

## Vision
To promote the idea of ‚Äòpractical philanthropy‚Äô among Nepalis living in and outside of Nepal.

## Mission
Encourage Nepalis and those who love Nepal around the world to donate at least ‚Äòone dollar a month‚Äô to the Network by sacrificing a can of beer or a cartoon of juice in a month.
